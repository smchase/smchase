### Hi, I'm Simon 👋

I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I’m always looking for new avenues to learn and grow, so feel free to shoot me a message!

**Current mission**: I'm working on an [improved app](https://moonboard.herokuapp.com) for the Moonboard 🌝 (a light-up climbing wall)

**Check this out**: I did a [write-up](https://github.com/smchase/Sudoku-Solver#how-it-works) on how I created a program to solve Sudokus really quickly 🚀
